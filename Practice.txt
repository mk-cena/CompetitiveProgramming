Graph Theory:
BFS (Parents, Single Source Shortest Paths)
DFS (Start Depth, End Depth, Paranthesis Theorem)
Edges
	Tree-Edge: ordinary edge between two unvisited nodes
	Forward-Edge: shortcut edge from ancestor node to decendant node
	Backward-Edge: shortcut edge from decendant node to ancestor node
	Cross-Edge: non backward and non forward edge between two visited nodes
Topological Sort (DFS/Ingoing Edges)
Strongly Connected Components (Coloring Components in an array, 0....n)
Handshake Lemma: Sum(deg(vertices)) = 2 * E
MST (KRUSKAL-PRIM)


Number Theory:
((b - a) / c) + test first, count of numbers divisible by c between a,b.
(((a + c - 1) / c) * c), first number divisible by c starting a.
Segmented/Sieve of Eratosthenes (prime generation)
Divisibility by 8 (last 3 digits divisible by 8)

CPP - SETS
Segmented Trees:
Range Minimum Query
Lazy Propagation
Divide Array into SQRT(N) segments with SQRT(N) elements
	- sort each segment
	- binary search each segment for queries
	- update segments:
		- if a whole segment is updated, no resort is required
		- else resort
